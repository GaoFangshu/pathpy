        paths: Path
            An instance of class Paths, which contains the path statistics to be used in
            the generation of the k-th order representation
        k: int
            The order of the network representation to generate. For the default case of
            k=1, the resulting representation corresponds to the usual (first-order)
            aggregate network, i.e. links connect nodes and link weights are given by the
            frequency of each interaction. For k>1, a k-th order node corresponds to a
            sequence of k nodes. The weight of a k-th order link captures the frequency
            of a path of length k.
        separator: str
            The separator character to be used in higher-order node names.
        null_model: bool
            For the default value False, link weights are generated based on the
            statistics of paths of length k in the underlying path statistics instance.
            If True, link weights are generated from the first-order model (k=1) based on
            the assumption of independent links (i.e. corresponding) to a first-order
            Markov model.
        method: str
            specifies how the null model link weights in the k-th order model are
            calculated. For the default method='FirstOrderTransitions', the weight
            w('v_1-v_2-...v_k', 'v_2-...-v_k-v_k+1') of a k-order edge is set to the
            transition probability transition_matrices['v_k', 'v_k+1'] in the first order network.
            For method='KOrderPi' the entry pi['v1-...-v_k'] in the stationary
            distribution of the k-order network is used instead.
