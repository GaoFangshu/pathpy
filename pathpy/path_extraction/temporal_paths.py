def paths_from_temporal_network(tempnet, delta=1, maxLength=_sys.maxsize,

    """create from a temporal network a Paths object
    Calculates the frequency of all time-respecting paths up to maximum length
    of maxLength, assuming a maximum temporal distance of delta between consecutive
    time-stamped links on a path. This (static) method returns an instance of the
    class Paths, which can subsequently be used to generate higher-order network
    representations based on the path statistics.

    Parameters
    ----------

    tempnet : pytest.TemporalNetwork
    delta : int
        Indicates the maximum temporal distance up to which time-stamped
        links will be considered to contribute to time-respecting paths.
        For (u, v;3) and (v,w;7) a time-respecting path (u,v)->(v,w) will be inferred
        for all 0 < delta <= 4, while no time-respecting path will be inferred for all
        delta > 4. If the max time diff is not set specifically, the default value of
        delta=1 will be used, meaning that a time-respecting path u -> v -> w will
        only be inferred if there are *directly consecutive* time-stamped links
        (u,v;t) (v,w;t+1). Every time-stamped edge is further considered a path of
        length one, i.e. for maxLength=1 this function will simply return the
        statistics of time-stamped edges.
    maxLength : int
        Indicates the maximum length up to which time-respecting paths should be
        calculated, which can be limited due to computational efficiency.
        A value of k will generate all time-respecting paths consisting of up to k
        time-stamped links. Note that generating a multi-order model with a maximum
        order of k requires to paths_from_temporal_network time-respecting paths with
        *at least* length k.
        If a limitation of the maxLength is not required for computational reasons,
        this parameter should not be set (as it will change the statistics of paths)
