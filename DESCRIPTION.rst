pathpy is an OpenSource python package for the analysis of time series data on networks using higher- and multi order network models. The package is tailored to analyse temporal networks as well as sequential data that capture multiple short, independent paths observed in an underlying graph topology. Examples for data that can be analysed include time-stamped social networks, user click streams in information networks, biological pathways, or information cascades in social networks.
